>**Note:** This was an experimental project that I did to demonstrate my understanding of Laravel and challenge my boundaries. Thanks to an opportunity to participate as a reserve in World Skills 2021 (Singapore), I had the chance to learn it. As a student, it was an amazing learning experience, and I enjoyed myself thoroughly. I aim to always maintain such an attitude for any projects that I may undertake in future.
